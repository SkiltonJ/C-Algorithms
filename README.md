# C Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my personal C implementations of various common algorithms. It's primarily a space for me to practice and solidify my understanding of these algorithms after successfully completing the 42 Piscine.

## Background

I recently completed the rigorous 42 Piscine, a challenging programming bootcamp focused on C. Due to recent business difficulties at my specific 42 school, I've decided to further my C skills by independently studying and implementing fundamental algorithms.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:

* **A learning journal:** Documenting my progress as I explore and implement different algorithms.
* **A practice ground:** Providing hands-on experience in translating theoretical concepts into working C code.
* **A personal reference:** Creating a collection of well-understood and implemented algorithms for future use.

## Current Algorithms Implemented

*(This section will be updated as I add more algorithms)*

* **Binary Search:** An efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half, eliminating half of the remaining elements at each step.
* **Prefix Sum:** A technique for efficiently calculating the sum of elements within a given range of an array. It involves creating a new array where each element stores the cumulative sum of the original array up to that index.
* **Sliding Window:** A technique used for solving array/string problems where you need to perform an operation on a contiguous subarray/substring of a specific size. It involves maintaining a "window" of elements and sliding it across the input.
* **Two Pointer:** A technique that uses two pointers to iterate through an array or linked list, often from opposite ends or at different speeds. It is useful for solving problems involving sorted arrays, finding pairs, or reversing elements.

## Future Goals

* Continue implementing a wide range of algorithms, including sorting, searching, graph traversal, and dynamic programming techniques.
* Focus on writing clean, efficient, and well-documented C code.
* Potentially explore performance analysis and optimization of the implemented algorithms.

## Notes

* This repository is primarily for my personal learning and reference.
* The code is written in C and compiled using [Your compiler, e.g., GCC].
* I will try to add comments to each algorithm, to explain my thought process.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. However, please note that this is primarily a personal repository.
